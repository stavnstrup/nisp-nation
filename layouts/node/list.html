{{ define "main" }}

<p>The taxonomy below consists of a subset of nodes from the C3 Taxonomy version 5.0 released on Sep 23, 2021.</p>

<p>Each node in the tree is prefixed with a number describing the level of the node in the tree (i.e. the distance from the root node).</p>

<p>Each node may also be postfixed with a tuple with three values, indicating:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The number of times a <em>mandatory</em> standard references a node in the taxonomy</li>
  <li>The number of times a <em>candidate</em> standard references a node in the taxonomy</li>
  <li>The number of times a taxonomy node is referenced from a <em>service profile</em></li>
</ul>
